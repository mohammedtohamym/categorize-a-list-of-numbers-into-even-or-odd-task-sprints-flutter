# Number Parity Checker

## Overview

This Dart program checks whether each number in a list of integers is even or odd. It iterates through the list, determines the remainder when dividing each number by 2, and uses a `switch` statement to classify the numbers. The result is printed for each number in the list.

## Code Details

### Core Logic

1. Iterate through the list of integers using a `for` loop.
2. Compute the remainder of each number when divided by 2:
3. Use a `switch` statement to classify the number:
    - If the remainder is `0`, the number is **even**.
    - If the remainder is `1`, the number is **odd**.
4. Print the result for each number.

### Output Example

For the provided list of integers, the output will be:
